# Description
This project provides a simple interface for a user to serialize data. The interface(s) can be implemented by calsses and structs and then serialized using any serializer build on this architecture. For a list of implementing frameworks and their usage visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Narumikazuchi/Serialization/wiki).
  
## Implementation
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Narumikazuchi.Serialization.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Narumikazuchi.Serialization)  
The installation can be simply done via installing the nuget package or by downloading the latest release here from github and referencing it in your project. You can then start to implement your own serializer and/or deserializer through the use of the provided interfaces.
